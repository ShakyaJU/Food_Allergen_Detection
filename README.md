<h1 align="center">Food Allergen Detection</h1>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"> For my final year undergraduate project, I have developed a Food Allergen Detection mobile application to help individuals, specifically those with food allergies, identify potential allergens in food items. Through extensive research on food allergies and allergenic ingredients, I explored how technology can enhance food safety. This app leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), a deep learning approach for image processing, to analyze food images and detect allergens in real-time. Users can simply capture/upload a food image to receive instant insights about possible allergens, empowering them to make informed and safe dietary choices. This project aims to improve food awareness, accessibility, and safety for individuals with dietary restrictions.</h3>

## Food Allergen Prediction:
The application predicts and gives three different outputs : 
- **Description**:  A human-readable explanation for the predicted class.
- **Predicted Class**: A label such as image of egg, pizza, milk, etc.
- **Allergen**: The allergenic component of the specific class, like Ovomucoid or Lactose Histamine, etc.
- **Allergen Detected/Not Detected message**: An alert message displaying whether allergen is detected or not
