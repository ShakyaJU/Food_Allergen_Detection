<h1 align="center">Food Allergen Detection</h1>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"> For my final year undergraduate project, I have developed a Food Allergen Detection mobile application to help individuals, specifically those with food allergies, identify potential allergens in food items. Through extensive research on food allergies and allergenic ingredients, I explored how technology can enhance food safety. This app leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), a deep learning approach for image processing, to analyze food images and detect allergens in real-time. Users can simply capture/upload a food image to receive instant insights about possible allergens, empowering them to make informed and safe dietary choices. This project aims to improve food awareness, accessibility, and safety for individuals with dietary restrictions.</h3>

## Food Allergen Prediction:
The application analyzes food images and provides four key outputs: 
- **Description**:  A clear, human-readable explanation of the predicted food item.
- **Predicted Class**: The identified food category (e.g., egg, pizza, milk).
- **Allergen**: The specific allergenic component present in the food (e.g., Ovomucoid, Lactose, Histamine).
- **Detection Status**: A alert message indicating whether an allergen has been detected or not.
